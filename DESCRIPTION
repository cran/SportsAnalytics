Description: The aim of this package is to provide infrastructure for
        sports analysis. Anyway, currently it is a selection of data
        sets, functions to fetch sports data, examples, and demos --
        with the ambition to develop bit by bit a set of classes to
        represent general concepts of sports analysis.
